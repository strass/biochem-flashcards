Q: What residue of the globins does the heme group coordinate with?
A: Proximal Histidine (specifically: His93 or His F8)

Q: What residue of the globins does the oxygen molecule coordinate with?
A: Distal Histidine (specifically: His64 or His E7)

C: The [association constant Ka] describes the [equilibrium between the complex and the unbound components of the complex].

C: A [high] Ka corresponds to [higher affinity of the ligand for the protein].

C: A [low] Ka corresponds to [lower affinity of the ligand for the protein].

C: [Equilibrium constants] are denoted with a [capital K].

C: [Rate constants] are denoted with a [lowercase k].

C: [Kd] corresponds to [affinity of ligand for the protein].

C: [Kd] is equivalent to the moalr concentration of ligand at which half of the available ligand-binding site are occupied.

C: A [sigmoid] binding curve suggests [cooperative binding].

Q: What is an allosteric protein?
A: One in which the binding of a ligand to one site affects the binding properties of another site on the same protein.

Q: What is a homotropic allosteric interaction?
A: When the normal ligand and modulator are identical.

Q: What is a heterotropic allosteric interaction?
A: When the ligand and modulator are not identical.
