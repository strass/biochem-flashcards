Q: What is the transition state of a reaction?
A: The highest energy, unstable intermediate structure formed during a chemical reaction, where bonds are partially broken and partially formed. Also called the activated complex.

Q: What is activation energy (Ea)?
A: The minimum energy required for reactants to reach the transition state and proceed to products. It represents the energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to occur.

Q: How do enzymes affect activation energy?
A: Enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction by stabilizing the transition state, making it easier for the reaction to proceed. They do NOT change the overall free energy (ΔG) of the reaction.

Q: What is transition state stabilization?
A: The primary mechanism by which enzymes catalyze reactions—the enzyme active site is complementary in shape and charge to the transition state, binding it more tightly than the substrate or product.

Q: How does transition state theory explain enzyme catalysis?
A: The rate of reaction depends on the concentration of molecules in the transition state. By stabilizing this state, enzymes increase its population and thus increase reaction rate.

Q: On a reaction coordinate diagram, what does the enzyme do to the curve?
A: It lowers the peak (activation energy) for both forward and reverse reactions, but the starting and ending points (reactants and products) remain at the same energy levels.

Q: What is ΔG‡ (delta G double dagger)?
A: The free energy of activation—the difference in free energy between the ground state (substrate) and the transition state. Enzymes lower ΔG‡.

Q: What is the Arrhenius equation and what does it tell us?
A: $k = Ae^{(-Ea/RT)}$. It shows that reaction rate (k) increases exponentially as activation energy (Ea) decreases or temperature (T) increases.

Q: What determines reaction speed?
A: 1: amount of substrate
2: amount of enzyme
3: catalytic properties of the enzyme
