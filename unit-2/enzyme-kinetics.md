Q: What is the transition state of a reaction?
A: The highest energy, unstable intermediate structure formed during a chemical reaction, where bonds are partially broken and partially formed. Also called the activated complex.

Q: What is activation energy (Ea)?
A: The minimum energy required for reactants to reach the transition state and proceed to products. It represents the energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to occur.

Q: How do enzymes affect activation energy?
A: Enzymes lower the activation energy of a reaction by stabilizing the transition state, making it easier for the reaction to proceed. They do NOT change the overall free energy (ΔG) of the reaction.

Q: What is transition state stabilization?
A: The primary mechanism by which enzymes catalyze reactions—the enzyme active site is complementary in shape and charge to the transition state, binding it more tightly than the substrate or product.

Q: How does transition state theory explain enzyme catalysis?
A: The rate of reaction depends on the concentration of molecules in the transition state. By stabilizing this state, enzymes increase its population and thus increase reaction rate.

Q: On a reaction coordinate diagram, what does the enzyme do to the curve?
A: It lowers the peak (activation energy) for both forward and reverse reactions, but the starting and ending points (reactants and products) remain at the same energy levels.

Q: What is ΔG‡ (delta G double dagger)?
A: The free energy of activation—the difference in free energy between the ground state (substrate) and the transition state. Enzymes lower ΔG‡.

Q: What is the Arrhenius equation and what does it tell us?
A: $k = Ae^{(-Ea/RT)}$. It shows that reaction rate (k) increases exponentially as activation energy (Ea) decreases or temperature (T) increases.

Q: What determines reaction speed?
A: 1: amount of substrate
2: amount of enzyme
3: catalytic properties of the enzyme

Q: Why is the lock and key model insufficient for explaining enzyme-substrate binding?
A: A perfect fit would stabilize the ground state of the substrate and would actually raise activation energy. The induced fit model is a better one because it explains where much of the catalytic power of the enzyme comes from.

Q: What is reaction velocity?
A: Concentration of product formed per unit time (mol/s)

Q: What is a reaction velocity graph?
A: Graph with reaction velocity on y axis and substrate concentration on x axis.

Determined by adding a fixed amount of enzyme to differing amounts of substrate concentration and 

Curve will be asymptotic as you approach saturating substrate concentrations.

Q: What is Vmax?
A: Maximum velocity of a reaction. Past this saturation point it doesn't matter if you add more of a substrate because the active sites of enzymes are already constantly occupied.

It is not fixed per reaction but is determined by how much enzyme is present.

Q: What is Kcat?
A: Turnover number, an intrinsic property of the enzyme that represents the number of products created by an enzyme in one second at saturating substrate concentrations.

$$K_{cat} = \frac{Vmax}{\text{\# active sites} * \text{total enzyme concentration}}$$

Q: What is a "perfect enzyme"?
A: One where Kcat is only limited by molecular diffusion.

Q: What is the Michaelis Constant Km?
A: Km is the substrate concentration at which V = 1/2 Vmax

Relates to affinity for substrate since more afifnity requires a lower concentration of substrate to reach saturation and Vmax.

C: A [high] Km corresponds to a [low] affinity of enzyme for substrate

C: A [low] Km corresponds to a [high] affinity of enzyme for substrate

Q: What is the Michaelis-Menten equation for an enzymatic reaction?
A: $$ v = \frac{V_{max}*[S]}{K_{M} + [S]}$$

Q: How do you graph the Michaelis-Menten curve in a linear format?
A: Graph by reciprocal of axes (1/v and 1/[S])

This gives you the Lineweaver-Burk or Double-Reciprocal Plot

X Intercept = -1/Km
Y Intercept = 1/Vmax
Slope = Km/Vmax
