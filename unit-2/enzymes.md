Q: Where does an enzymatic reaction occur?
A: Specialized pocket called Active Sites

Q: What are some ways in which the active site promotes reactions?
A: - Strong binding
- Lack of water molecules

Q: Common amino acids in general acid-base catalysis
A:

Q: How does pH affect enzyme activity?
A: Enzymes are calibrated to the pH they expect to be working in. Different AA residues have distinct pH ranges in which the are most able to participate in acid-base catalysis .

Q: What is the role of the oxyanion hole?
A: Stabilizes transition states during catalysis.

Q: What is the catalytic triad in chymotrypsin?
A: SHA - Serine Histidine A

Q: What are the seven enzyme classes?
A:
- Oxidoreductases       - Transfer of electrons (hydride ions or H atoms)
- Transferases      - Group transfer
- Hydrolases        - Hydrolysis (transfer of functional groups to water)
- Lyases        - Cleavages of C-C, C-O, C-N, or other bonds by elimination, leaving double bonds or rings, or addition of groups to double bonds.
- Isomerases        - Transfer of groups within molecules to yield isomeric forms
- Ligases       - Formation of C-C, C-S, C-O, and C-N bonds by condensation reactions coupled to ATP cleavage or similar cofactor.
- Translocases      - Movement of molecules or ions across membranes or their separation within membranes.

Q: What is the enzyme-substrate complex?
A: \ce{
$\underset{\text{Free Enzyme \& Substrates}}{E + S}$ <=> 
$\underset{\text{Substrate Binding}}{ES}$ <=> 
$\underset{\text{Reaction}}{ES{*}}$ <=> 
$\underset{\text{Product Formation}}{EP}$ <=> 
$\underset{\text{Release of Products}}{E + P}$
}

- Enzymes lower activation energy of a reaction
- An enzyme that catalyzes \ce{S -> P} also catalyzes \ce{P -> S}.
- Enzymes accelerate the interconversion of S and P.
- Enzymes are not used up in the process.
- The equilibrium point is unaffected.
- Enzymes enhance rate in range of 5 to 17 orders of magnitude.

Q: How do enzymes lower activation energy of a reaction?
A: With an enzyme it takes less energy to reach the transition state. This is done through stabilizing the transition states of the reaction.

Q: What is the steady state of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction?
A: Experiment: excess substrate added to enzymes.
Pre-steady staete: Brief, rapid buildup of ES complex.
Steady state: period during which [ES] and other intermediates remain constante. [S] changes as substrate is converted to product.
The ES complex is in a dynamic equilibrum, meaning that moleucles are constantly binding and unbinding from the enzyme, but the overall concentration of the complex remains relatively constant.

In a graph you'll see [P] increasing linearly, in pre-steady state [E] is lowering and [ES] is rising. In steady state they become flat.
