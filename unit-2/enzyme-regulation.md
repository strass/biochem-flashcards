Q: What are some of the ways in which activities of enzymes are regulated?
A:
- Allosterism: reversible, noncovalent binding of regulatory compounds called allosteric modulators or allosteric effectors
- Binding of separate regulatory proteins
- Reversible covalent modification
- Removal of peptide segments by proteolytic cleavage

Q: How do allosteric enzymes work?
A: Allosteric enzymes undergo conformational changes in response to modulator binding.

If modulator binds to regulatory subunit, the catalytic subunit changes shape making it more active.

Q: What are types of modulators?
A: Homotropic whether the substrate and modulator are identical

Heterotropic modulators: modulator is molecule other than substrate; different from allosteric inhibitor.

Q: How is Aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) regulated?
A: End product (CTP nucleotides) feeds back to ATCase and it slows it down; ATP is a positive regulator - if there's a lot around it supports the cascade.

When CTP binds to R-state ATCase it induces a contraction in the regulatory dimer that causes the catalytic trimers to come together, decreasing enzyme activity. ATP has the opposite effect where it binds to the T-state enzyme and moves the catalytic trimers to move apart and increasing catalytic activity.

Q: How do allosteric enzymes affect the Michaelis-Menten curve?
A: Will produce a sigmoid saturation curve rather than a hyperbolic curve. This is usually due to cooperation, where changes in the structure of one subunit are translated into structral changes in the adjacent subunits.

For a homotropic enzyme a small increase in [S] in the steep part of the curve causes a comparatively large increase in V0

Q: What are phosphoryl groups?
A: Protein kinases catalyze the attachment of phosphoryl groups to specific amino acid residues using ATP at common structural motifs. Can be positive or negative regulation depending on how it affects the R group's interaction with other proteins.

Phosphoprotein phosphatases can remove phosphoryl groups.

Q: What are commonly phosphorylated amino acid residues?
A: Ser, Thr, Tyr, (lesser extend His)

Q: How is muscle glycogen phosphorylase activity regulated?
A: Glycogen phosphorylase is regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylase b can be phosphorylated into Phosphorylase a when needed.

Phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 de-activates it.

Q: What is a zymogen?
A: A zymogen is an inactive precursor that is cleaved to form an active protease enzyme.

Called proprotein or proenzyme, suffixes and prefixes include "-ogen", "pre-" and "pro-"

Q: Where is it common to find zymogens?
A: Digestive enzymes need to only be active when in the right location. 

Trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen are zymogens produced by the pancrase and are activated to trypsin and chymotrypsin in the small intestine by membrane-bound enteropeptidases.

Pepsinogen is the zymogen form of pepsin, an enzyme found in the stomace that aids in the digestion of proteins.

Q: How does blood clotting work?
A: Clot is an aggregate of platelets cross-linked and stabilized by proteinaceous fibers consisting mostly of fibrin. Fibrin is derived from the soluble zymogen fibrinogen.

Collagen exposure to blood starts the cascade by releasing signaling molecules. Trauma can activate tissue factors too.

Many zymogens, XII -> XIIa, XI -> XIa, Prothrombin -> Thrombin, Fibrinogen -> Fibrin

Q: What is hemophilia?
A: Disease caused by deficiency in clotting factors.

- Hemophilia A: factor VII
- Hemophilia B: factor IX
