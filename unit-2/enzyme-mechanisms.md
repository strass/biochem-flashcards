Q: What is the catalytic triad in chymotrypsin?
A: Ser195, His57, Asp102.

Q: How can you tell if an AA residue is important for catalytic function?
A: Site-specific mutagenesis and efficiency assay.

Q: What is chymotrypsin?
A: A protease (an enzyme that catalzyes the hydrolytic cleavage of peptide bonds). Optimal activity at pH 8.

Pancreatic digestive enzyme that cleaves proteins after an aromatic residue.

Two phases:
    - Acylation phase: peptide bond is cleaved and an ester linkage is formed between the peptide carbonyl carbon and the enzyme.
    - Deacylation phase: ester linkage is hydrolyzed and nonacylated enzyme is regenrated.

Q: Describe the chymotrypsin mechanism
A: Polypeptide substrate binds, the side chain of the aromatic residue adjacent to the peptide bond to be cleaved nestles in a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme, positioning the peptide bond for attack.

A conformational change (Ser & His) allows the histidine to remove a proton from serine to form a strongly nucleophilic alkoxide ion (on Ser). The alkoxide ion attacks the peptide carbonyl group to form a tetrahedral acyl-enzyme with a short-lived negative charge on the substrate carbonyl oxygen. This negative charge is briefly stabilized by hydrogen bonds within the oxyanion hole.

Because the negative charge is unstable the tetrahedral intermediate collapses and the carbon oxygen double bond reforms. This displaces the carbon nitrogen bond of the peptide linkage, breaking the peptide bond. The amino leaving group is protonated by His, facilitating its displacement. The rest of the initial substarate remains in the active site as part of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, because it is covalently linked to the active site enzyme.

For deacylation, water enters the active site. Histidine deprotonates the incoming water molecule by general base catalysis to produce a strongly nucleophilic hydroxide ion that attacks the ester linkage of the acylenzyme intermediate, producing a new tetrahedral intermediate. Within the new intermediate the carbonyl oxygen again takes on a temporary negative charge within the oxyanion hole.

Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate forms the second product, a carboxylate anion, and displaces Ser195. Histidine then donates a proton to the active site serine & second product leaves. Enzyme regenrates.

Q: Hexokinase
A: Adds phosphate group to six carbon sugars. Undergoes induced fit on substrate binding, beta-d-Glucose --> Glucose 6-phosphate.

When glucose (but not water) and Mg ATP bind, the binding energy derived induces a conformational change in hexokinase to the catalytically active form.

Similar sugars such as xylose (5C) somewhat resembles glucose but cannot be phosphorylated. Binding of xylose in the hexokinase active site induces a conformational change in hexokinase to its active conformation, ATP is hydrolyzed, and hexokinase is "tricked" into phosphorylating water.

Q: How are reactions aided by metal ions?
A: Enolase catalyzes the reversible dehydration of 2-Phosphoglycerate to Phosphoenolpyruvate

Lys345 abstracts a proton by general base catalysis, two Mg2+ ions stabilize the resulting enolate intermediate. Glu211 facilitates elimination of the -OH gorup by general acid catalysis.
