C: [Enantiomers] are [non-superimposable mirror images]

C: [Diastereomers] are [stereoisomers that are not mirror images]

Q: What is a stereoisomer?
A: A molecular with one or more chiral centers (asymmetric carbon atoms)

C: A [racemic] mixture has [equal parts R and S enantiomers]

Q: What is cis-trans isomerism?
A: Cis-trans isomers are stereoisomers (same molecular formula and connectivity) that differ in the spatial arrangement of groups around a rigid structure that prevents rotation.

Q: Why is stereochemistry important?
A: Enzymes and receptors typically recognize and interact with only one stereoisomer. 

Q: How do you name stereoisomers?
A: Give each group attached to the chiral carbon a priority, put 4 in the back, if numbers count 1-2-3 clockwise then it's R, counterclockwise then S

Q: How do you assign priority to groups attached to a chiral center?
A: More or less atomic number. O > N > C > H. If there's a tie go to the second molecule
