Q: What is the standard arrangement of a carbon atoms four single bonds?
A: A tetrahedral arrangement with 109.5° angles.

Q: What types of bonds limit rotation?
A: Double & triple bonds.

C: [Enthalpy] is abbreviated as [H]

C: [Entropy] is abbreviated as [S]

C: [Free energy] is abbreviated as [G]

Q: What is Enthalpy?
A: Heat content, roughly reflecting the number and kinds of bonds.

C: Free energy [G] = [H - TS]

C: In the free energy eqn, when ∆H is [negative] heat is [released]

C: In the free energy eqn, when ∆S is [positive] entropy is [increased]

C: Spontaneous reactions occur when [∆G] is [negative].

C: [Endergonic] reactions [require energy]

C: [Exergonic] reactions [release energy]

Q: How are non-spontaneous reactions performed?
A: By coupling them to exergonic reactions.

Q: What is a common exergonic reaction in cells?
A: Breakage of phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP

C: [$K_{eq}$] is a reactions [equilibrium constant]

Q: What is the formula for the equilibrium constant?
A: $$K_{eq} = \frac{[C]^c_{eq} [D]^d_{eq}}{[A]^a_{eq} [B]^b_{eq}}$$

C: A [large] value for $K_{eq}$ means the reactants are [completely] converted.

C: A [small] value for $K_{eq}$ means the reactants [partially] converted.

Q: What is standard free energy change?
A: $$\Delta G = \Delta G^\circ + RT ln \frac{[C]^c_{i} [D]^d_{i}}{[A]^a_{i} [B]^b_{i}}$$

C: Reactions can do [no work] at [equilibrium]

Q: What are the various macromolecules and what do they build in the cell?
A: The four classes of macromolecules are polysaccharides, nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Polysaccharides, such as starch and glycogen, primarily store energy and provide structural support. Nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA, store and transmit genetic information, while ATP (a nucleotide) stores energy. Proteins, composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, perform a wide range of cellular activities, including catalysis, transport, and structural support. Lipids, such as phospholipids and triglycerides, form cellular barriers like the plasma membrane and store energy.
