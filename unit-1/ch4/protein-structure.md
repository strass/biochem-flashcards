Q: What is the primary structure of a protein?
A: Primary structure of a protein is the linear sequence of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. This
sequence is determined by the genetic code and dictates all higher levels of structure and function.

Q: What is the secondary structure of a protein?
A: Secondary structure refers to local folding patterns stabilized by hydrogen bonds between backbone
atoms. Common secondary structures include the alpha-helix and beta-pleated sheet, as well as turns
and loops that connect these elements

Q: What is the tertiary structure of a protein?
A: The tertiary structure is the overall three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain formed by
interactions between side chains. These interactions include hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonding,
ionic interactions, disulfide bridges, and van der Waals forces.

Q: What is the quaternary structure of a protein?
A: The quaternary structure describes the arrangement and interaction of multiple polypeptide subunits
into a functional protein complex. These subunits are held together by the same types of interactions
seen in tertiary structure.

Q: What is the geometric arrangement of a peptide bond?
A: The peptide bond has a rigid, planar geometry due to partial double-bond character.
The C-N bond in the peptide linkage exhibits resonance between:

- Single bond form: C-N (with C=O)
- Double bond form: C=N (with C-O⁻)

This creates approximately 40% double-bond character, which restricts rotation around the C-N bond.

While the peptide bond itself is rigid, the polypeptide backbone can still fold because rotation IS allowed around:

φ (phi): rotation around N-Cα bond <br />
ψ (psi): rotation around Cα-C bond <br />
Although many φ (phi) and ψ (psi) values are prohibited by steric interference.

These torsion angles determine the protein's secondary structure (α-helix, β-sheet, etc.).

Q: What determines a protein's secondary structure?
A: Torsion angles between φ and ψ form (α-helix, β-sheet, etc.).

Q: What are some common secondary structures in protein?
A: $\alpha$ helix, $\beta$ sheets, $\beta$ turns, random coils

Q: What is an $\alpha$ helix?
A: Common protein secondary structure. Right-handed helix is formed as multiple hydrogen bonds wind the protein backbone around an imaginary longitudinal axis with R groups facing outwards.

Q: Which amino acid residues occur infrequently in an $\alpha$ helix?
A: Proline and glycine.

Proline's cyclic structure and rigid backbone make it difficult to accommodate the regular hydrogen
bonding pattern of an alpha helix.

Glycine's small side chain provides it with greater conformational flexibility than other amino acids.
This flexibility, while beneficial in other protein structures like beta turns, can destabilize an alpha
helix.

Q: What is the $\beta$ conformation in polypeptide chains?
A: A conformation that organizes polypeptide chains into sheets.

A $\beta$ strand is formed by extending the backbone into a zigzag. Several strands side-by-side form a $\beta$ sheet.

Q: How does protein folding minimize free energy?
A: Proteins fold spontaneously to achieve the lowest free energy state (most stable conformation). The driving force is ΔG < 0 (negative free energy change).

Q: What is a native protein conformation and how is it formed?
A: A protein folded correctly is said to be in its "native" conformation. Chemical interactions stabilize native conformations.

C: Adjacent segments of [antiparallel] $\beta$ sheets are connected via [$\beta$ turns] 

Q: What are common amino acids in $\beta$ turns?
A: Proline (Type I) and Glycine (Type II)

Q: How do Ramachandran plots work?
A: They test quality of 3d protein structures by plotting all φ and ψ angles which represents allowed conformations of protein backpone dihedral angles.

Q: What are the four major types of protein groups and how are they grouped?
A: The groups are based on polypeptide chains:

- fibrous proteins: arranged in long strands or sheets
- globular proteins: folded into a spherical or globular shape
- membrane proteins: embedded in hydrophobic lipid membranes
- intrinsically disordered proteins: lacking stable tertiary structures

Q: What are defining traits of fibrous proteins?
A: Fibers give strength and/or flexibility to structures

They contain simple repeating element of secondary structure

Insoluble due to high concentrations of hydrophobic residues

Q: Where can fibrous proteins be found:
A: Keratin (hair), collagen (tendons), fibroin (silk).

Q: What is a protein motif?
A: Motifs are recognizable folding patterns involving multiple elements of secondary strucutre and the connection(s).

Ex: β-α-β loop or β barrel

Q: What is an intrinsically disordered protein?
A: Intrinsically disordered proteins:

- lack definable structure
- often lack a hydrophobic core
- high densities of charged residues (Lys, Arg, Glu) and Pro
- facilitates a protein to interact with multiple binding partners

C: [Chaperones] assist with [protein folding].
