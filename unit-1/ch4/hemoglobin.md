Q: Describe hemoglobin
A: Found in erythrocytes (red blood cells)

Transport oxygen

Has quaternary structure; 4 polypeptide chains, 2 alpha 2 beta, 4 heme groups (can carry 4 O2 molecules)

Also binds CO2 and brings it back to the lungs to be exhaled.

Q: How is myoglobin similar to hemoglobin
A: Structurally similar to hemoglobin subunits. Has 1 heme group (can bind 1 O2); facilitates O2 diffusion in muscle tissue.

Q: What is a heme prosthetic group?
A: A prosthetic group with a porphyrin holding an iron atom in the middle. Can have an oxidation state of up to +6. Bound to 4 nitrogens of protoporphyrin. It can form 2 other bonds (above and below plane)

Q: What are hemoglobins conformational states?
A: T (tense) and R (relaxed). O2 binding to hemoglobin in the T state triggers a conformational change to the R state.

- T: Low oxygen affinity
- R: high oxygen affinity

It is important to think of the T and R states in terms of affinity to O2 not the presence or absense of O2

Q: Describe the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve
A: Y axis is hemoglobin oxygen saturation, X is pO2 (oxygen partial pressure). There is a curve. To the left of the curve represents unloading O2, right of curve represents Binding O2

Myoglobin's curve is slightly different - it hangs on to O2 and releases it all at once while hemoglobin releases more readily.

Q: How does hemoglobin bind oxygen?
A: Hemoglobin binds oxygen cooperatively - when one subunit binds O2, the conformational change in that subunit make it more likely that the other subunits will bind O2.

The reverse is true as well. Sensitivity of hemoglobin to oxygen and the cooperativiety of the quaternary strucutre make this protein uniquely adapated to pick up oxygen in the lungs and deliver it to tissues.

Q: Describe the concerted and sequential models of substrate binding in hemoglobin
A: Concerted model posits that the molecule is always flipping back and forth between T and R state as a unit, but the reversability of that reaction varies according to O2 loading. Unlikely to stay relaxed when unsaturated, likely to stay in R when saturated.

Sequential model says each of the 4 subunits starts off in T but when an oxygen binds, the subunit turns into R and creates conformational changes in adjacent T's which are more likely to bind which creates the cooperative effect. As the molecule becomes more saturated, the R subunits also become 'more relaxed' into their final shape.

Experimentally we find something in-between the two. The concerted model cant be right because we don't see a change in conformation each time. However it's not quite piecemeal like sequential model would suggest either.

Q: How is oxygen binding to hemoglobin regulated?
A: 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) is a byproduct of glycolysis -> pyruvate.

It has many negative charges. If cell is going through a lot of glycolysis (active metabolically) it will have more 2,3-BPG which will start to interact with hemoglobin.

2,3-BPG is an allosteric effector of hemoglobin, binds at the centrer of the holocomplex (lined with positively charged residues) and stabilizes the T state. The decreased affinity for oxygen forces oxygen to be delivered at actively respiring tissues.

As the hemoglobins circulate to the lungs, pO2 increases and forces the R state to occur, squeezing out the 2,3-BPG.

At high altitudes extra 2,3-BPG is created due to lowered oxygenation of peripheral tissues (due to separate mechanism) which in turn decreases oxygen affinity causing more O2 to be released.

Q: How does pH effect O2 binding to hemoglobin?
A: When O2 high, hemoglobin binds O2 and releases H+

When O2 low, hemoglobin releases O2 and binds H+

A lower pH makes it easier for hemoglobin to release oxygen, while a higher pH makes it harder.

Bohr effect: hemoglobin also carries CO2 as an end product of cellular respiration. CO2 binding stabilizes the T state.

Increased CO2 or decreased pH reduces the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, meaning hemoglobin wil more readily release oxygen into the tissues. Critical for meeting oxygen demand of metabolically active tissues (release CO2 as a byproduct).

Q: How is fetal hemoglobin different from adult?
A: Fetal hemoglobin has 2 alpha and 2 gamma subunits instead of beta.

Has a lower affinity for 2,3-BPG than normal adult hemoglobin. Therefore it has higher affinity for O2 than normal adult hemoglobin. This ensures fetus gets the oxygen it needs.

Q: What is sickle cell disease
A: Monogenic homozygous condition caused by a single amino acid substitution in hemoglobin beta chains. Hydrophobic patches affect solubility.

Sickle cell trait is the heterozygous condition with some but not all the symptoms.

Deoxygenated hemoglobin HbS becomes insoluble and forms polymers that aggregate. This changes the shape of the erythrocyte and cells turn over more quickly. Additionally the shape can cause them to accumulate in capillaries which is very painful. Can still carry oxygen but sickled erythrocytes have impaired circulation and there are fewer of them (causing anemia).

Was one of the first attempted treatments via CRISPR. Took blood from patients, did gene editing, and re-infused into patients. Increase expression of gamma hemoglobin which would normally only be seen in fetus.
