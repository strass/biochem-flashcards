Q: What is the general structure of an amino acid?
A: Central carbon (Cα) bonded to: amino group (NH₂), carboxyl group (COOH), hydrogen, and R group (side chain)

Q: What is the Isoelectric Point of a neutral amino acid?
A: $pI \approx {(pKa_1 + pKa_2) \over 2}$

Q: What are the ionization states of an amino acid?
A: Ionization States:

- At low pH: both groups protonated (+H₃N-CHR-COOH)
- Near pI: zwitterion (+H₃N-CHR-COO⁻)
- At high pH: both groups deprotonated (H₂N-CHR-COO⁻)

Q: How are amino acids chained?
A: Two amino acids residues are condensed with a peptide bond (covalent)

Q: How is a peptide bond created?
A: Two amino acids form a covalent bond through a dehydration reaction linking the c-terminus of AA1 to the n-terminus of AA2.

Q: What are the N-terminus and C-terminus of a polypeptide chain?
A: A polypeptide begins with the Amine-Terminus/N-Terminus and ends with the Carboxyl-Terminus/C-Terminus

Q: What are the 5 main classes of amino acids by R group?
A: Five main classes:
- nonpolar, aliphatic (7)
- aromatic (3)
- polar, uncharged (5)
- positively charged (3)
- negatively charged (2)

Q: What are the nonpolar, aliphatic R groups?
A: Glycine, Alanine, Proline, Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Methionine

Q: What are the aromatic R groups?
A: Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Tryptophan

Q: What are the polar, uncharged R groups?
A: Serine, Threonine, Cysteine, Asparagine, Glutamine

Q: What are the positively charged R groups?
A: Lysine, Arginine, Histidine

Q: What are the negatively charged R groups?
A: Aspartate, Glutamate

Q: What are some special amino acids?
A:
- Cys: forms disulfide bonds (S-S)
- Pro: creates kinks in chains (cyclic structure)
- Gly: smallest, most flexible
- His: pKa ≈ 6, can be protonated or not at physiological pH

Q: What is the importance of the side chain to the behavior of an amino acid?
A: The side chain (R group) determines the class of amino acid and will determine folded protein structure.

Q: How do amino acids affect pH?
A: Amino acids can act as both acids and bases, meaning they provide buffering power to a solution
