Q: What is the standard arrangement of a carbon atoms four single bonds?
A: A tetrahedral arrangement with 109.5° angles.

Q: What types of bonds limit rotation?
A: Double & triple bonds.

C: [Enthalpy] is abbreviated as [H]

C: [Entropy] is abbreviated as [S]

C: [Free energy] is abbreviated as [G]

Q: What is Enthalpy?
A: Heat content, roughly reflecting the number and kinds of bonds.

C: Free energy [G] = [H - TS]

C: In the free energy eqn, when ∆H is [negative] heat is [released]

C: In the free energy eqn, when ∆S is [positive] entropy is [increased]

C: Spontaneous reactions occur when [∆G] is [negative].

C: [Endergonic] reactions [require energy]

C: [Exergonic] reactions [release energy]

Q: How are non-spontaneous reactions performed?
A: By coupling them to exergonic reactions.

Q: What is a common exergonic reaction in cells?
A: Breakage of phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP

C: [$K_{eq}$] is a reactions [equilibrium constant]

Q: What is the formula for the equilibrium constant?
A: $$K_{eq} = \frac{[C]^c_{eq} [D]^d_{eq}}{[A]^a_{eq} [B]^b_{eq}}$$

C: A [large] value for $K_{eq}$ means the reactants are [completely] converted.

C: A [small] value for $K_{eq}$ means the reactants [partially] converted.

Q: What is standard free energy change?
A: $$\Delta G = \Delta G^\circ + RT ln \frac{[C]^c_{i} [D]^d_{i}}{[A]^a_{i} [B]^b_{i}}$$

C: Reactions can do [no work] at [equilibrium]
