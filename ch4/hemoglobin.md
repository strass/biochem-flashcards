Q: Describe hemoglobin
A: Found in erythrocytes (red blood cells)

Transport oxygen

Has quaternary structure; 4 polypeptide chains, 2 alpha 2 beta, 4 heme groups (can carry 4 O2 molecules)

Also binds CO2 and brings it back to the lungs to be exhaled.

Q: How is myoglobin similar to hemoglobin
A: Structurally similar to hemoglobin subunits. Has 1 heme group (can bind 1 O2); facilitates O2 diffusion in muscle tissue.

Q: What is a heme prosthetic group?
A: A prosthetic group with a porphyrin holding an iron atom in the middle. Can have an oxidation state of up to +6. Bound to 4 nitrogens of protoporphyrin. It can form 2 other bonds (above and below plane)

Q: What are hemoglobins conformational states?
A: T (tense) and R (relaxed). O2 binding to hemoglobin in the T state triggers a conformational change to the R state.

T: Low oxygen affinity, R: high oxygen affinity

It is important to think of the T and R states in terms of affinity to O2 not the presence or absense of O2

Q: Describe the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve
A: Y axis is hemoglobin oxygen saturation, X is pO2 (oxygen partial pressure). There is a curve. To the left of the curve represents unloading O2, right of curve represents Binding O2

Myoglobin's curve is slightly different - it hangs on to O2 and releases it all at once while hemoglobin releases more readily.

Q: How does hemoglobin bind oxygen?
A: Hemoglobin binds oxygen cooperatively - when one subunit binds O2, the conformational change in that subunit make it more likely that the other subunits will bind O2.

The reverse is true as well. Sensitivity of hemoglobin to oxygen and the cooperativiety of the quaternary strucutre make this protein uniquely adapated to pick up oxygen in the lungs and deliver it to tissues.
